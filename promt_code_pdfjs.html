new specs:

here are the requirements Please generate a full HTML/JS file using PDF.js versions as https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.10.377/pdf.min.js and

for pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSr use https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.10.377/pdf.worker.min.js

The Objective is to create a navigable PDF highlighting keywords.

The PDF will be a multi-page PDF to be loaded from a URL variable.

Do not show highlighting initially.

Keywords are grouped into categories. Assign a highlighting color to each category and set the category name background and border to the corresponding category color in the navigation section.

Next, for each category, create a check box next to its initial value, and check that the box not checked.

When the checkbox next to a category is checked, then display the keywords and the corresponding page number matched in the PDF, as a list with no background. Each keyword and page number shall be hyperlinked.

If the user clicks on the hyperlink, the system should scroll the PDF to that page and matched keyword.

Highlighting in PDF should be in the colors specified for that category.

Once user checks the box next to category then show highlighting from that category in the corresponding color.

highlighting should be the exact match on the pdf including substrings.

Categories and keywords are given in a JSON array. Use the array to drive the highlight colors.
Two Jasons will drive the system.


First, Jason will be categorized, and the associated colors are given below.

CATEGORY = {
    	   "Names": "#FFFF00 ",
    	   "Dates": "#ADD8E6",
    	   "Medications": "#00FF00",
    	   "Vitals": "#FFA500",
    	   "Diagnosis": "#FF00FF",
    	   "Tests": "#FFB6C1",
    	   "Devices": "#00FFFF "
 };

Second, Jason will have groupings of keywords. example:

PDF_HILIGHTING_NAV = {

  "Dates": [
    "10/7/13",
    "9/3/2013",
    "9/28/13"
  ],

  "Names": [
    "Krista Switzer",
    "Ellen Goodwater"
  ],

  "Medications": [
    "Tylenol",
    "Zithromax"
  ],

  "Vitals": [
    "BP: 90/68",
    "P: 78",
    "T: 100.6 (tympanic)",
    "R: 18",
    "WT: 30lbs",
    "HT: 34 inches",
    "BMI: 18.2"
  ],

  "Tests": [
    "Rapid strep in office"
  ],

  "Diagnoses": [
    "Strep Pharyngitis",
    "Upper respiratory infection",
    "Eustachian tube dysfunction",
    "Serous otitis",
    "Otitis media",
    "Pneumonia"
   ],
   "Devices": []
 }

For testing, use the PDF I uploaded, use http://localhost/epd/soap.pdf.pdf


If there are no entries for a category, do not show it on the navigation.
Create a PDF.js embedded HTML.
